# Digital Alarm Clock
NTHU CS 410100; Instructor: Chung-Ta King

In the final project, I made an Arduino-based digital alarm clock that shows real-time information by connecting the DS1302 module.
Users can set the alarm time using the keypad, and the clock rings when the alarm time is due.
Furthermore, the clock automatically senses ambient light and noises, to interactively change screen brightness and volume.
